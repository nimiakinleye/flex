          >What if I want to stop using the Services?</span
        >
        <br />
        You may stop using the Services, close your Flex Account, and cancel
        these Terms at any time by contacting us at contact@myflex.fun and
        providing sufficient information for us to verify your identity.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there are any pending transactions
        relating to your Flex Account when we receive your termination notice,
        we will close your Flex Account promptly after such transactions are
        completed. Your termination of these Terms will not affect any of our
        rights or your obligations arising under these Terms prior to
        termination.
        <br />
        <br />
        Upon the closure of your Flex Account, we will transfer the funds in
        your Flex Account, if any, to your Bank Account on or after withdrawal
        date with the charges inclusive. If your Bank Account is closed or we
        are otherwise unable to transfer the funds in your Flex Account to your
        Bank Account, we will send you a check for the amount of the funds to
        you at your street address in our records on or after the withdrawal
        date.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you do not use the Services for a certain period of time, applicable
        law may require us to report the funds in your Flex Account as unclaimed
        property. If this occurs, we may try to locate you at the address shown
        in our records. If we are unable to locate you, we may be required to
        deliver any funds in your Flex Account to the applicable state as
        unclaimed property. The specified period of time to report and deliver
        funds to a state varies by state, but usually ranges between two and
        five years. Provisions of these Terms that, by their nature, should
        survive termination of these Terms will survive termination of these
        Terms.

        Also, there are terms and conditions of service applicable to our
        offline services such as trips and events where we ensure the safety of
        our users on the trip and events. You may be subjected to body search to
        ensure nobody brings onboard harmful substances, hard drugs, or other
        harmful elements. You may also be subjected to be excused even if you
        have made payment for the trip or event if you are found to have broken
        any safety rule or be in contempt to have found to abuse other people
        onboard physically or emotionally, which may result to your being
        excused at any time and may incur additional lawsuit as at the time of
        occurence or in future.
        <br />
        <br />
        Flex and other third party stakeholder reserves the right to determine
        if you are eligible for trips and events under applicable law such as
        your age, health and character-wise.

        <br />

        these Terms and our rights and obligations hereunder without your

        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        Governing Law. These Terms are made under and will be governed by and
        construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of
        Nigeria, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the

        <br />
        <br />
        DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; JURY TRIAL WAIVER; CLASS
        ACTION WAIVER. For any and all controversies, disputes, demands, claims,
        or causes of action between you and us (including the interpretation and
        scope of this Section and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute,
        demand, claim, or cause of action) relating to the Services or these
        Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had
        with us), you and we agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute,
        demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through binding and
        confidential arbitration. The arbitration will take place in the federal
        judicial district of your residence. As used in this Section, "we" and
        "us" mean Flex and its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors,
        successors, and assigns and all of its and their respective employees,
        officers, directors, agents, and representatives. In addition, "we" and
        "us" include any third party providing any product, service, or benefit
        in connection with the Services or these Terms (as well as any related
        or prior agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is
        named as a co-party with us in any controversy, dispute, demand, claim,
        or cause of action subject to this Section.
        <br />
        <br />
        Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any
        state arbitration law. The arbitration will be conducted before one
        commercial arbitrator from the Nigeria Arbitration and Conciliation Act
        with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes.
        As modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the
        parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the Nigeria
        Arbitration and Conciliation Act’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if
        the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for
        Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "Rules and Procedures").
        <br />
        <br />
        You should review this provision carefully. To the extent permitted by
        applicable law, you are GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or
        defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims
        court in the state or municipality of your residence within the
        jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such
        matter is only pending in that court. Additionally, notwithstanding this
        agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief
        in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state
        court located in the federal judicial district of your residence in
        order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and each party
        hereby agrees to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the
        courts located within the federal judicial district of your residence
        for such purpose. A request for interim measures will not be deemed a
        waiver of the obligation to arbitrate.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge
        or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration
        procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN
        COURT. Arbitrators’ decisions are as enforceable as any court order and
        are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
        <br />
        <br />
        You and we must abide by the following rules: (A) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY
        YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS
        A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
        PROCEEDING; (B) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE
        PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
        REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF;
        (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of
        arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation,
        we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with
        the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
        arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of
        litigation, (d) we also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive
        discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the
        arbitration; (e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and
        privacy recognized at law; (f) the arbitration will be confidential, and
        neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of
        any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for
        purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (g) subject to the
        limitation of liability provisions of these Terms, the arbitrator may
        award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly
        permitted by applicable law; and (h) each party will pay its own
        attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that
        requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation
        expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and expenses to
        the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded
        will be determined by the applicable law
        <br />
        <br />
        This Section will survive termination of your Flex Account and these
        Terms as well as any voluntary payment of any debt in full by you or any
        bankruptcy by you or us. With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) of
        this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis),
        if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid,
        unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and
        Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain
        in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the
        invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting part was not contained
        herein. If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) of this Section is found
        to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this
        arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor we will
        be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court
        rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in
        federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state
        court located in the federal judicial district of your residence.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision, you must notify us
        of your election in writing within 30 days of the date that you first
        became subject to this arbitration provision or within 30 days of the
        effective date of any material change to these Terms by sending a
        written notice to us by certified mail at the following address: Flex
        Digi-Tech Nigeria Limited, Office: (insert address here)., Attn:
        Arbitration Opt-Out. Your opt-out notice must include your name,
        address, phone number, and email address.
        <br />
        <br />
        Miscellaneous. You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing,
        and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments
        associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided
        that we may, in our sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your
        behalf or for ourselves. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in
        any way, any right herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further
        rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be
        unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated,
        to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms will otherwise
        remain in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms, together
        with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire and sole agreement
        between you and us with respect to the Services and supersedes all prior
        understandings, arrangements, or agreements, whether written or oral,
        regarding the Services. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are
        not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Flex, and you do
        not have any authority of any kind to bind PiggyVest in any respect
        whatsoever.

          >Will Flex ever change these Terms or the Services?</span
        >
        <br />
        We may add to or terminate any of the Services or amend these Terms at
        any time, in our sole discretion, without providing notice to you,
        subject to applicable law. We reserve the right, subject to applicable
        law, to deliver to you any notice of changes to existing terms or the
        addition of new terms by posting an updated version of these Terms on
        the Website or delivering notice thereof to you electronically. You are
        free to decide whether or not to accept a revised version of these
        Terms, but accepting these Terms, as revised, is required for you to
        continue accessing or using the Services. If you do not agree to these
        Terms or any revised version of these Terms, your sole recourse is to
        terminate your access or use of the Services. Except as otherwise
        expressly stated by us, your access and use of the Services are subject
        to, and constitute your acceptance of, the version of these Terms in
        effect at the time of your access or use.
